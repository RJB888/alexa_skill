# AIM - Alexa Intelligent Messaging


Alexa Intelligent Messaging is the newest, easiest way to stay in touch with your family. 

Be in two places at the same time with Alexa's most exciting new skill. With Alexa's new voice recognition and recorded messaging functionality Alexa detects a voice, for whom you have programmed a message beforehand. Now you can let people know where they left their keys, or the game remote, or whatever message you need to share when they'll need it the most.

To recap, the project builds on existing voice command technology to build out a type messaging ability for registered users. We are in the process of researching and scoping our project. First the research and then the scope.
We plan to continue to look into basic uses of the Alexa, what it already can do. And we plan before the beginning of next week to take the codecademy class for how to set up an Alexa skill. In addition we plan to look into other online classes specifically geared for Alexa skill production.
The voice command interface means that we register users by voice. From these registrants, we set a series of command words. We then define a process for posting a message and getting a message. Within posting message, we define the ability to edit. Within getting message, we define the ability to slow down, speed up, repeat message. We define a save feature and other features that might be similar to a voice messaging on a cellphone.
That's what we have for now.

To contribute to this project will require you to install the necessary packages for working with Amazon Alexa Skills Development.  

This will be updated as the project progresses.
